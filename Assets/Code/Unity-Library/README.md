# About
This is a generic code library that may be useful for any kind of project done in Unity.
It is meant to be included as a submodule in other Unity projects.

Currently it relies on the new Unity's input system. The scripting define symbols DEBUG_LOG and DEBUG_RENDER should also be added in order to use some of the classes that wrap Unity's debug system.
